# rl_examples

This repository contains examples of Reinforcement Learning algorithms implemented in Python.

Mention that this is not a framework or library, but rather a collection of examples. I'll provide codes showing how to invoke APIs of different RL platforms and incorporate them with RL algorithms.

## Dependencies

- gymnasium 0.29.1
- gymnasium[toy-text]

## File Structure

- 'dp': Dynamic Programming examples
- 'td': Temporal Difference (TD) learning examples

## TODO

To implement examples of different simulation or RL platforms. 
Platforms that can be considered include:

- [ ] OpenAI Gym(ongoing)
- [ ] PyBullet
- [ ] MuJoCo
- [ ] Isaac Sim
