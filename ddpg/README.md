# Algorithm Introduction

Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is an off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that is particularly effective in continuous action spaces. Developed by Silver et al. in the paper "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search" as part of the AlphaGo project, DDPG has since been successfully applied to a variety of complex control tasks.
